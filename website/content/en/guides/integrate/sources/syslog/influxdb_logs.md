Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you'll have significant blind spots. But collecting and
analyzing them can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you
need to solve the basic task of collecting your logs, but
you must do it in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more
frustrating than having your logs pipeline fall on it's
face during an outage, or even worse, cause the outage!

Fear not! In this guide we'll build an observability pipeline that will
send logs from Syslog to InfluxDB.

## Background

### What is Syslog?

[Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) stands for System Logging Protocol and is a standard protocol used to send system log or event messages to a specific server, called a syslog server. It is used to collect various device logs from different machines and send them to a central location for monitoring and review.

### What is InfluxDB?

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData. It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] observability
data pipeline. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it lightweight,
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And we'll be
deploying Vector as a [agent][docs.roles#agent].

  sourceName={"syslog"}
  sinkName={"influxdb_logs"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

We'll build an observability data pipeline that:

<div className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">

  * Receives logs from [Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog).
    * Enriches data with useful Syslog context.
    * Supports TCP keepalive for efficient resource use and reliability.
    * Securely receives data via Transport Layer Security (TLS).
  * Sends logs to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/).
    * Buffers data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.
    * Compresses data to optimize bandwidth.
    * Automatically retries failed requests, with backoff.
    * Securely transmits data via Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    * Batches data to maximize throughput.

</div>

**All in just a few minutes!**

1.  ### Install Vector

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.vector.dev | sh

1.  ### Configure Vector

    ```bash
    none

1.  ### Start Vector

    ```bash
    vector --config ./vector.toml

1. ### Observe Vector

    <Tabs
      className="mini"
      defaultValue="metrics"
      values={[
        {
          label: "Metrics",
          value: "metrics",
        },
      ]}
    >
    <TabItem value="metrics">

    ```bash
    vector top
    ```

    <CodeExplanation>

    This commond interacts with a live Vector instance through it's [API][docs.api]
    to visualize activity. For more information, please refer to the
    [metrics section][docs.monitoring#metrics] in the
    [monitoring guide][docs.monitoring].
