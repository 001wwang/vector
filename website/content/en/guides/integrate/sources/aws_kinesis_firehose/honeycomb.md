Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you'll have significant blind spots. But collecting and
analyzing them can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you
need to solve the basic task of collecting your logs, but
you must do it in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more
frustrating than having your logs pipeline fall on it's
face during an outage, or even worse, cause the outage!

Fear not! In this guide we'll build an observability pipeline that will
send logs from AWS Kinesis Firehose to Honeycomb.

## Background

### What is AWS Kinesis Firehose?

[Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) is a fully
managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations
such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift,
Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES), and Splunk.

### What is Honeycomb?

[Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) provides full stack observabilityâ€”designed for high cardinality data and collaborative problem solving, enabling engineers to deeply understand and debug production software together.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] observability
data pipeline. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it lightweight,
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And we'll be
deploying Vector as a [agent][docs.roles#agent].

<DaemonDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"aws_kinesis_firehose"}
  sinkName={"honeycomb"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

We'll build an observability data pipeline that:

<div className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">

  * Receives logs from [AWS Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/).
    * Enriches data with useful AWS Kinesis Firehose context.
    * Securely receives data via Transport Layer Security (TLS).
  * Sends logs to [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io).
    * Buffers data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.
    * Compresses data to optimize bandwidth.
    * Automatically retries failed requests, with backoff.
    * Securely transmits data via Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    * Batches data to maximize throughput.

</div>

**All in just a few minutes!**

1.  ### Install Vector

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.vector.dev | sh

1.  ### Configure Vector

    ```bash
    none

1.  ### Start Vector

    ```bash
    vector --config ./vector.toml

1. ### Observe Vector

    <Tabs
      className="mini"
      defaultValue="metrics"
      values={[
        {
          label: "Metrics",
          value: "metrics",
        },
      ]}
    >
    <TabItem value="metrics">

    ```bash
    vector top
    ```

    <CodeExplanation>

    This commond interacts with a live Vector instance through it's [API][docs.api]
    to visualize activity. For more information, please refer to the
    [metrics section][docs.monitoring#metrics] in the
    [monitoring guide][docs.monitoring].
