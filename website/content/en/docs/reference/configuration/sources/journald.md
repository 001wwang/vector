## How it works

### Checkpointing

{{< snippet "checkpointing" >}}

### Communication strategy

To ensure that the `journald` source works across all platforms, Vector interacts with the Systemd journal via the [`journalctl`][journalctl] command. This is accomplished by spawning a subprocess that Vector interacts with. If the `journalctl` command isn't in the environment path you can specify the exact location via the [`journalctl_path`][journalctl_path] option. For more information on this communication strategy, please see [issue 1473][issue_1473].

### Context

{{< snippet "context" >}}

### Non-ASCII messages

When `journald` has stored a message that isn't strict ASCII, it outputs it in an alternate format to prevent data loss. Vector handles this alternative format by translating such messages into UTF-8 in "lossy" mode, where characters that are not valid UTF-8 are replaced with the Unicode replacement character (`ï¿½`).
