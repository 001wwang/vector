title: Field path notation reference
short: Field path notation
---

Throughout Vector's configuration you'll notice that certain options take field paths as values, such as the `rename_fields` transform. In order to reference nested or array values, you can use Vector's field path notation. This notation is not anything special, it simply uses `.` and `[<index>]` to access nested and array values, respectively.
