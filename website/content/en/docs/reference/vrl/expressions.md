## Syntax

VRL programs can be constructed with the following syntax rules.

{{% vrl/data "syntax" %}}

## Literal expressions

As in most other languages, **literals** in VRL are values written exactly as they are meant to be interpreted. Literals include things like strings, Booleans, and integers.

{{% vrl/data "literals" %}}

## Dynamic expressions

VRL is an expression-oriented language. A VRL program consists entirely of expressions and every expression returns a value.
