Vector Remap Language (VRL) is an expression-oriented language designed for transforming observability data (logs and metrics) in a [safe](#safety) and [performant](#performance) manner. It features a simple [syntax](expressions) and a rich set of built-in functions tailored specifically to observability use cases.

You can use VRL in Vector via the remap transform, and for a more in-depth picture, see the announcement blog post.
