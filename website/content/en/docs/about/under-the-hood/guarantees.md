title: Guarantees
---

Vector attempts to make it clear which guarantees you can expect from it. We categorize all components by their targeted delivery guarantee and also by their general stability. This helps you make the appropriate trade-offs for your use case.

Here you can find an overview of delivery guarantee types and their meaning as well as how we label the stability of our components. Next, you can head over to the [components] page and use filters to see which components support specific guarantees.
