Vector strives to be a good example of observability and therefore includes various facilities to observe and monitor Vector itself. It is intentionally designed to be composable and fit into your existing workflows.

## Logs

Vector has taken care to add quality, structured logs throughout its codebase. In this section we'll show you how to access and route them.

### Routing logs

By default, Vector emits its logs over `STDOUT`. This allows you to redirect logs through system-level utilities like any other service. If you're using a process manager like Systemd, logs should be collected for you and made available through utilities like [Journald]. This means that you can collect Vector's logs like other logs on your host. In the case of Systemd/Journald, you can use Vector's [`journald` source]:

```toml
[sources.vector_logs]
type = "journald"
include_units = ["vector"]
```

### Configuring logs

#### Levels

Log levels can be adjusted when [starting] Vector via the following methods:

Method | Description
:------|:-----------
`-v` flag | Drops the log level to `debug`
`-vv` flag | Drops the log level to `trace`
`-q` flag | Raises the log level to `warn`
`-qq` flag | Raises the log level to `error`
`-qqq` flag | Disables logging
`LOG=<level>` environment variable | Set the log level. Must be one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `off`.

#### Stack traces

You can enable full error backtraces by setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` environment variable. More on this in the [Troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting].

## How it works

### Event-driven observability

Vector employs an event-driven observability strategy that ensures consistent and correlated telemetry data. You can read more about our approach in [RFC 2064][rfc_2064].

### Log rate limiting

Vector rate limits log events in the hot path. This enables you to get granular insight without the risk of saturating IO and disrupting the service. The trade-off is that repetitive logs aren't logged.
